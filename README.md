Genealogy Keeper is a hobby side-project for exploring a new take on genealogical data and editor. It will aspirationally support both a desktop and web application view, with all data owned and stored by the user. The app interface should be intuitive and all features able to be explained within the app. It will use a new data format separate from GEDCOM.
